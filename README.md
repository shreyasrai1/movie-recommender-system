# 🎬 **Movie Recommender System**

A **content-based movie recommendation system** built using Python, designed to suggest similar movies based on textual features like overview, genres, cast, and more. This project utilizes **cosine similarity** and **TF-IDF vectorization** to match movies by content.

<br/>

## 📌 **Project Highlights**

- 🔍 Recommends movies using heuristics and vectorisation techniques
- 🧠 Uses an unsupervised, content-based filtering approach
- ⚙️ Built in Jupyter Notebook
- 🗃️ Clean, modular, and beginner-friendly

<br/>

## 🧾 **Dataset Source**

The movie metadata used in this project was **downloaded from [Kaggle(TMDB- 5000 Movie Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)**. TMDB provides extensive, community-maintained data on movies and TV shows.



<br/>

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data handling
- **Scikit-learn** for vectorization and similarity
- **NLTK**
